DataPublishScheme.py is the main source code of our project, and the other py files are auxiliary or test files.
To see the experiment results, both DataPublishScheme.py and th corresponding exe file can be run, and the 
interpreter should be python 2.7.

Note that packages including  matplotlib.pyplot, numpy and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (for visualization) should 
be installed beforehand to run the program smoothly, or just run the exe file which requires no new packages.

During the running process of the program, after watching the graph window, please shut it down so that the
next graph can be shown. Ignore the warning and failure (if any) shown on the console, please focus on the print
data on it instead.

Contact me via Hazelnut@sjtu.edu.cn or 903909408@qq.com if there's any problem. Have a nice day : )
