DataPublishScheme.py is the main source code of our project, and the other py files are auxiliary or test files.
To see the experiment results, both DataPublishScheme.py and th corresponding exe file can be run, and the 
interpreter should be python 2.7.

Note that packages including  matplotlib.pyplot, numpy and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (for visualization) should 
be installed beforehand to run the program smoothly.
